            "no longer insisting on people being graduates for certain job roles a survey by the Pew Research Center said that nearly half Americans believe it's less important that people have a college degree a University degree then it was 20 years ago and major companies like apple IBM and Hilton according to this article have got rid of the requirement for\n",

            "what's the language degrees employers look at it that if you speak another language then great sometimes that can be an important Advantage but unless you want to become a language teacher you're going to need to train us something else on top of your language degree plus with the ability to learn a language online like with our own dear Adept English language is something you can learn along the way additional skills\n",
            "I don't need to spend your whole degree opportunity on learning the language what else does Jerry Robinson list well she talks about Visual and Performing Arts degrees as often ending in debt d e b t and disappointment degrees in acting dance or fine art are very enjoyable but they don't teach business skills or skills in networking or\n",
            "all the skills you need to freelance even that means to work for yourself to freelance f r e e l a n c e and yet many 17 and 18 year olds are encouraged down this path there are no definite jobs and it's just the hope of a lucky break if you do want to study an arts degree at an Arts University then my suggestion would be something like graphic design which has a clear real world business application my daughter\n",
            "graduated in 2019 with a degree in graphic design and she has had work as a graphic designer ever since that one works the article also talks about special interests degrees by this it means gender studies or ethnic studies Terry Robinson says important conversations absolutely marketable degree subjects not often the word\n",
            "marketable m a r k e t a b l e mean something that you can sell or in terms of a degree is it something that's going to get you a job so gender studies degrees and ethnic studies degrees may be important but they don't have a clearly defined job market outside of Academia outside of universities even teaching in the department where you\n",
            "did your degree there aren't going to be jobs for all the graduates doing that so if you're doing your degree for interest then these are great for exploring critical social issues but these degrees don't provide training for practical job roles also in this article with the title many college degrees are useless here's what's worth your money it's also talks about psychology and psychology\n",
            "this is a fascinating subject and hugely popular in the UK here at schools offer a psychology a level often as well but if you have a psychology degree what are the options well the NHS does employ graduate psychologists but not many of them and they're barely on minimum wage that means they're paid little more than the legal minimum if you want\n",
            "make it and have a career as a psychologist you'll need to do a doctorate after you've completed your degree so that's another 3 years full-time study in most cases there are various options for psychologists in the UK the most common path is a doctorate in Clinical Psychology so you become a clinical psychologist this is the sort of General psychologist that the NHS employs most so you will\n",
            "find a job if you have this doctorate to pursue this you need a good psychology degree and some experience working in a relevant Department probably NHS before you can even apply to the doctorate and the competition for doctoral programs in the UK is fierce hundreds of people for each place because in the UK the doctor is funded that means the government pay for it\n",
            "are the doctors that you can add on to your psychology degree and bear in mind none of these are funded you'll pay for these yourself forensic so you can do a doctor at the trains you to become a forensic psychologist that's f o r e n s i c a means to do with the subject of criminals and criminology Law and Order and the justice system very interesting\n",
            "of course and if you're a forensic psychologist you may find employment in the prison service or the probation service in the UK but you'll have to fund your training yourself other options you can train as a health psychologist another doctorate so again you pay yourself and the NHS do employees some health psychology but not many you could also trained to be an educational psychologist\n",
            "change my schools but again not many and you have to pay yourself so these are all difficult paths for psychologists the psychology doctorate that is nearest to my own qualification in Psychotherapy is the doctor in counseling psychology and this qualifies you to be a counseling psychologist and the NHS does employee counseling psychologist and like me you could work in private practice seeing\n",
            "but again you'll have to pay for it yourself when I did my master's degree in Psychotherapy the first four years of the training where exactly the same as the counseling psychology doctorate so I know what's involved it's another long and difficult path and it's expensive it's not just the cost of your tuition fees which you have to pay for yourself you're living costs but you also need to pay for your own personal\n",
            "repeat the supervision of your client work and you need to give your time for free seeing clients no one pays you for your client work whilst you're in training so it's a difficult and long path but it's well worth it it took me 5 years to get my qualification but I consider myself extremely lucky my career is so rewarding and after 25 years I still love it and I can't imagine doing\n",
            "anything else however if I done a psychology degree rather than a Latin degree in the first place my path would have been a lot easier so guiding our sons and daughters guiding our young people to choose what is the right degree for them is hugely important and close to my heart or perhaps do another podcast or episode a companion piece if you like\n",
            "what degrees are really useful for the world of work or you can read it yourself the link to the article in Forbes Magazine is in the transcript but I'll cover this in more accessible English that will make a good English lesson I hope you've enjoyed this podcast and found it useful and don't forget to share this podcast with other people that's a way of helping Adept English gain more listeners and it also means\n",
